# No Vowels!

Write a program that prompts the user for a sentence and then replaces all the vowels in the sentence with the letter 'x'. The program should then display the modified sentence to the user.


## Examples
```
noVowels("Hello world!") ➞ "Hxllx wxrld!"

noVowels("I like pizza") ➞ "x lxkx pxzzx"

noVowels("The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain") ➞ "Thx rxxn xn Spxxn fxlls mxxnlx xn thx plxxn"
```

## Testing
Open your terminal and use the command `npm test -- no-vowels.test.js` to run the necessary tests.
