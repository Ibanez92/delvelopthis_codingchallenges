The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.

## Examples
```
factorial(4) ➞ 24

factorial(1) ➞ 1

factorial(5) ➞ 120
```

## Testing
Open your terminal and use the command `npm test -- factorial.test.js` to run the necessary tests.
